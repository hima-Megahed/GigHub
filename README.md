# Gighub
GigHub is a real-world mini social networking application developed using **Agile-Scrum methodology** in an
**Object-Oriented** manner through applying modern design patterns **(e.g. Repository & UnitOfWork &
Dependancy Injection)**.
GigHub was developed For live music lovers 🎧 so musicians can sign up and list their upcoming gigs and their
followers can see all the upcoming gigs on the home page or search for them by artist, genre or location and
then they can add their favorite gigs to their calendar. Once a musician 🎤 updates or cancels one of their
upcoming gigs, users who are attending that gig will see a notification when they login.
